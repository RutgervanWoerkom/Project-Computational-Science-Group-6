# Modeling Australian forest fire spreading using cellular automata

In past months it was hard to miss, big parts of Australia are on fire threatening nature, humans and wildlife. Altogether, this makes it important and interesting to investigate how wildfires spread. In this project forest fires are simulated using cellular automata and influenced by the set of environmental factors:
- vegetation density
- height,
- temperature
- rain
- wind

## Prerequisites
The code is written and tested in
```python
Python 3.7
```
To run the code make sure the following python packages are installed:

- IPython
- jupyterlab
- numpy
- matplotlib
If not, the packages can be installed using
```python
pip3 install <package name>
```
## Usage
1. Open **src/main.ipynb** to configure and run the model.
2. (Optional) Replace environmental factors in **datasets/...** to alter the model.
